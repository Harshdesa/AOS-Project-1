# AOS-Project-1
In this project, you have to design and implement a broadcast service in a distributed system. Assume a distributed system in which nodes are arranged in a c ertain topology (specified in a configuration file). Build a spanning tree using a distributed algorithm of your choice. (Feel free to design your own algorithm.) Once the spanning tree constr uction completes, each node should know which subset of its neighbors are also its tree neighbors . Use the spanning tree constructed above to implement a broad cast service that allows any node to send a message to all nodes in the system. The broadcast ser vice should inform the source node of the completion of the broadcast operation. For this proje ct, assume that only one broadcast operation can occur at any time.
